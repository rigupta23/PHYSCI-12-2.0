       <h1>About Me</h1> 

<p>Hi! My name is Ria! I am a rising junior in highschool. I like to play Tennis, play Chess, travel, and cook. My favorite subjects in school are Math, Science, and History. I had been interested in taking Intro to Digital Fabrication because I am curious about how the devices and machines that surround my daily life are created from scratch and have always wished to do the same.</p>
