  ### About Me

  Hello! My name is Ria Gupta! I'm a rising senior in high school
  and I'm really excited to take Intro to Digital Fabrication!
  Some of my hobbies are playing tennis, playing Chess, cooking, and I
  also like to travel a lot! I wanted to take this course because I've always been interested in how 
  to make things from scratch which is exactly what this course is for.
