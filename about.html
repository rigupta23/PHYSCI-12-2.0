  ### About Me

   Hello! My name is Ria Gupta. I am a rising senior in high school. My favorite academic subjects are topics in Math and Science but I like some topics in History like Global politics and foreign relations too. Apart from my academic subjects, I like to play tennis, play chess, cook, and travel! I chose to take Intro to Digital Fabrication because I have always been interested in the roots of how things were created. I want to know how to make highly developed functioning devices and machines from small mechanic parts with this course.
